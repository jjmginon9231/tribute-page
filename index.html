                    on <time datetime="1901-02-02">February 2, 1901</time>, in Vilnius, Lithuania, (then part of The
                    Russian Empire. His extraordinary aptitude for the violin was evident from a young age, and He began
                    learning the violin at the age of three. I was born into a Lithuanian-Jewish Family in Vilnius. His
                    father, Reuven Heifetz, was a local violin teacher, and recognized Early on, the son shown enormous
                    talent. By the age of seven, Jascha had made his public debut, captivating audiences in Kovno (now

                    Heifetz's journey continued when he enrolled in Ionnes Nalbandian's violin class at the Saint
                    Petersburg Conservatory, where he eventually studied under the great Leopold Auer. His silky tone,

                    imprint on the music scene. His Carnegie Hall debut drew thunderous acclaim, and fellow violinist
                    Fritz Kreisler famously said, "We might as well take our fiddles and break them across our knees."
                    Heifetz was the highest-paid violinist in the world at the age of 18, cementing his virtuoso
                    position.
