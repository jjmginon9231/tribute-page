# Tribute Page

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/83b4507a-3c79-4a04-9330-b12a7dc4a3cf/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tribute-page-2024/deploys)

This is a tribute page project created as part of the **[freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/#build-a-tribute-page-project)**. The project follows the user stories provided by freeCodeCamp and incorporates best practices for HTML and CSS which I learned from **[Dave Gray](https://github.com/gitdagray)**.

## Project Description

The Tribute Page is dedicated to **[Jascha Heifetz](https://jaschaheifetz.com/about/)**, a remarkable individual who has made significant contributions to violin music and performing arts. The page provides a brief overview of his life, achievements, and impact.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and layout.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the page looks good on various screen sizes using media queries.
- **Semantic HTML Tags**: Utilized appropriate tags (such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.) for better accessibility and SEO.
- **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)**: Applied fonts using CSS.
- **Images**: Included relevant images to enhance the visual appeal.

## User Stories Implemented

1. As a user, I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
2. As a user, I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the tribute subject.
